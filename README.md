# Lobbipad's Slack integration

With the Lobbipad + Slack integration, Lobbipad will send a Slack direct message to your employees every time a visitor arrives to see them.‍

On our integrations page you can find the Slack option.

Start by enabling the Slack integration. 

Then, pick 'Add to Slack' and start the process of linking your Slack company account to Lobbipad. 

We only request the permissions we need to send your hosts private messages when a visitor arrives. 

Make sure to pick the correct Slack company account.

Finally,  press 'Update Slack settings', and you're good to go.
